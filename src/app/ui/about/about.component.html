    projects, for companies in various industries, such as <a class="text-white hover:text-secondary" href="https://www.tracker.co.za" target="_blank">vehicle-tracking</a>,

      management</a> & <a class="text-white hover:text-secondary" href="https://www.dvt.co.za" target="_blank">software solutions.</a>
